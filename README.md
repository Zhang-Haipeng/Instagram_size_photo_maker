# Instagram size photo maker

I've been seeing on Instagram that people sending two portrait oriented photos, so that when you swipe, it feels like scrolling over one big landscape oriented photo.   
I'm sure there are apps to make that happen, but I couldn't find it. So I decided to make this little photo maker for myself. It's simple but it works.

# How to use  
1. Save your original landscape photo into "pics" folder.
2. In the python program, change the **pic_name = "pics/your_photo's_name.jpg"**.
3. Run the program. And the output photos will be in "output" folder. (There will be **three** output photos - xx_left, xx_right, xx_centered.)

# Issues
1. The output photos are much smaller in size than expected. Although the quality looks just good. (?)
2. More to be added
